Some maintenance/repair hints:
- the used solder is very poor quality. Heats up in a high temperature and my device had cracks in several solder joints.
- the coils are held back just by the glue, without it they are very loose
- the tantalum capacitors are the resin-dip type, which apparently is suspectible to catch on fire. Their function is to set the soft-start time constant and limit the shortcut current. Hard to say if they are picked to start exactly in the same time or they start in a specific order - didn't check.
- the transformer windings are just assumed, I didn't measure them. There is an additional connection on the primary side - maybe for 110V?
- not all caps or pots have values. To read them i would need to desolder or measure, for which I didn't have the chance. The capacitor between L and PE most likely has a value written on the other side, but a different capacior is in the way.
- there is a connection between PE and the computer plug shield.
